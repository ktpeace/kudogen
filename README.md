# KUDOGEN

This will be a compliment generator for people you know. It's a fun combination of direct input and unpredictable results, half user prompts and half personality test for a third party.

## TO DO AS OF 1/17

### IMMEDIATE

- first generate adjectives by picking randomly 1 of the 4 options of each array in adjectiveList
- this pushes the chosen adjectives as a prop to Results
- in Results, check chosen adjectives against resultDescriptions to find winner
- give description and image matching the winner
- add adjective logic to pull correct image/desc
- create 'take screenshot/save image' button in results

### NEXT

- fill in adjectives, feelings, colors
- add can't submit message and submit button validation

### LATER

- add reset button for adjs + feelings
- make home emoji section look better
- change tagline and favicon
- make responsive
- refactor code
- change colors to not need to plug in hashtags so any color format works in arrays
- make sure results starts with scrollbar at top
- why can't I right click open submit button
