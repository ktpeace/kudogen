# KUDOGEN

This will be a compliment generator for people you know. It's a fun combination of direct input and unpredictable results, half user prompts and half personality test for a third party.

## TO DO AS OF 1/28

### IMMEDIATE

- make responsive
- fix routing on live site (can't go straight to results)

### NEXT

- make actual .png sizes smaller & remove unneeded from project
- move defaults to original states

### LATER

- add reset button for adjs + feelings
- remove unnecessary dependencies like htmltocanvas
- remove camera icon from results screenshot
- refactor code
- change colors to not need to plug in hashtags so any color format works in arrays
- make sure results starts with scrollbar at top
- handle a default routing/404 case
- why can't I right click open submit button
- add more feelings
